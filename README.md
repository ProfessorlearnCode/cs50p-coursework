# 💻 CS50P – My Journey Through Harvard's Intro to Programming with Python

Welcome to my solutions and personal notes from **CS50’s Introduction to Programming with Python (CS50P)** — a beginner-friendly course offered by Harvard University, taught by David J. Malan.

---

## 🧠 What is CS50P?

**CS50P** is a deep dive into the world of programming using Python — without assuming any prior coding experience. Unlike CS50x (which starts with C), this course teaches computational thinking, problem-solving, and software design using Python as the foundation.

### Key Topics Covered:
- Variables, Conditionals, Loops
- Functions, Arguments, Return values
- File I/O and Exception Handling
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Regular Expressions
- Unit Testing and Code Design
- Web Scraping, APIs, and Libraries

---

## ❓ Why CS50P?

As someone pursuing Computer Science, I wanted to:
- **Strengthen my core Python skills**
- **Practice problem-solving through hands-on psets**
- **Learn to think like a programmer**, writing clean, tested, and efficient code
- **Explore real-world Python applications**, from file manipulation to testing and data scraping

CS50P offered all of that and more. It was an engaging, hands-on, and rewarding experience.

## 📁 What’s Inside This Repo?

Each folder here corresponds to a **problem set (pset)** or project from the course. These include weekly assignments and my final project.

| Folder | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `bank`, `bitcoin`, `coke`, etc. | Individual psets testing various concepts (e.g. conditionals, loops, functions, APIs) |
| `test_*` | Unit testing exercises |
| `Final_Project` | My final project (separate repo coming soon) |
| `nutrition`, `plates`, `scourgify` | Real-world inspired programming challenges |
| `emoji`, `twtttr`, `shirtificate` | Fun projects focused on strings, formatting, and output |
| `outdated`, `indoor`, `response` | Working with files, APIs, and scraping web data |
| _and many more..._ | See the folders for all challenges completed! ✅ |

> Most programs include **docstrings**, are **PEP8 compliant**, and in some cases include **unit tests** using `pytest` or custom test scripts.

## 💬 My Remarks

Completing CS50P was like leveling up in how I think about coding. Here’s what I personally gained:

- A **deeper confidence** in solving programming problems from scratch
- Comfort with reading and writing **Pythonic code**
- Exposure to **real-world tools** like regular expressions and file handling
- Motivation to build bigger things — CS50P directly contributed to my later AI & IoT projects like `pixID` and `Intelli-Nutri`.

---

## 🚀 Future Work

I plan to:
- Break down some solutions in blogs or comments
- Polish my **final project** and release it as a standalone repo
- Use CS50P foundations in more advanced projects (Flask apps, APIs, and LLMs!)
